## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Semantic Bridge Discovery

# Find how "optimization" appears across different domains
nebula = KnowledgeNebula("research_nebula")
bridges = nebula.find_semantic_bridges("optimization", 
                                     target_domains=["ml", "logistics", "ui_design"])
# Result: Shows optimization in ML training, route planning, and performance tuning
```

### Use Case 2: Technology Thread Following
```python
# Follow "Python" across all use cases
python_thread = nebula.follow_technology_thread("Python")
# Result: Shows Python in web dev, data science, automation, AI, etc.
```

### Use Case 3: Learning Path Navigation
```python
# Find learning path from current knowledge to target
path = nebula.find_skill_progression("basic_programming", "machine_learning")
# Result: Programming → Data Analysis → Statistics → ML Fundamentals → Advanced ML
```

### Use Case 4: Cross-Level Deep Dive
```python
# Start broad, drill down to specifics
results = nebula.cross_level_query("data preprocessing")
# Level 1: All graphs about data preprocessing
# Level 2: Preprocessing layers within those graphs  
# Level 3: Specific preprocessing nodes (cleaning, normalization, etc.)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Performance at Scale
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching and lazy evaluation from start
- **Fallback**: Limit nebula size and implement result pagination

### Medium Risk: Embedding Quality
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple embeddings, iterate based on results
- **Fallback**: Manual positioning system if embeddings fail

### Low Risk: Visualization Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple 2D visualization, add 3D later
- **Fallback**: Text-based navigation if visualization proves difficult

- **Sprint 03**: Advanced Nebula Intelligence (AI-powered recommendations)
- **Sprint 04**: Multi-Modal Nebulae (code, images, audio integration)
