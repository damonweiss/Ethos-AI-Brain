# Agent Zero Vision

## Core Architecture

### Input Flow
1. **Agent Zero** receives a user prompt
2. **Immediate LLM Analysis** via inference engine
3. **Binary Decision Output**

### Decision Tree

**Path A: Complex Strategy** 
- LLM determines the prompt requires multi-step reasoning
- Returns a **strategy/plan** for solving the complex problem

**Path B: Direct Resolution**
- LLM determines it can be solved immediately
- Returns either:
  - **Direct answer** (knowledge-based response)
  - **Tool execution** (single tool call needed)

## The Brain Component

**Agent Zero** isn't just routing - it has a **Brain** with:
- **Memory** - Context from previous interactions, learned patterns
- **Reasoning** - Meta-reasoning engines for complex problem solving
- **Knowledge** - Accumulated understanding and domain expertise

### Brain-Enhanced Decision Making

The LLM analysis leverages the Brain's capabilities:
- **Memory-informed** decisions based on conversation history
- **Reasoning-powered** strategy generation for complex problems  
- **Knowledge-augmented** responses drawing from accumulated learning

## Technical Architecture

### Inference Engine = Brain's Reasoning Core
- **`inference_engines/`** - The core reasoning execution layer
  - `LLMEngine` - Universal LLM interface using LiteLLM
  - `BaseInferenceEngine` - Abstract contract for all inference types
  - Handles actual model execution and reasoning

### Supporting Brain Components
- **`meta_reasoning/`** - Higher-level reasoning orchestration  
  - `ReasoningManager` - Built on top of the inference engines
  - Manages reasoning context, confidence levels, execution modes
- **`inference_model_manager/`** - Model selection and metadata management

### The Flow
- **Inference Engines** = The "brain cells" that do the actual thinking
- **Meta-Reasoning** = The "orchestrator" that manages complex reasoning workflows  
- **Model Manager** = The "librarian" that manages which models to use

## Agent-Brain Relationship

### Agent = Prompt Generator + Actor
**Agent's Role:**
1. **Generates prompts** → Asks Brain targeted questions
2. **Processes Brain's responses** → Interprets what Brain returns  
3. **Acts on the results** → Takes concrete actions in the world

**Agent's Acting Capabilities:**
- **Tool execution** → Calls MCP tools
- **External API calls** → Interacts with services
- **File operations** → Reads/writes files
- **User communication** → Responds to user
- **Environment manipulation** → Changes system state

### Brain = Pure Processing Engine
**Brain's Role:**
- **Processes prompts** from the Agent through thought processors registry
- **Routes to appropriate inference engines** (LLM, Vision, Embeddings)
- **Returns processed results** back to the Agent
- **Never acts directly** → Stays pure, only processes

### Complete Agent Zero Flow
1. **User input** → Agent receives
2. **Agent prompts Brain** → "Analyze this for complexity"
3. **Brain processes** → Routes through thought processors + prompt router
4. **Brain returns analysis** → "Complex, needs strategy" 
5. **Agent prompts Brain** → "Create strategy for this"
6. **Brain returns strategy** → "Step 1: X, Step 2: Y"
7. **Agent ACTS** → Executes Step 1, then Step 2

## Prompt Router Insights

### Prompt Router = Brain's Decision Gateway
- **Engine Selection** → Decides LLM vs Vision vs Embeddings
- **Model Selection** → Picks specific model within engine type
- **Input Analysis** → Infers best approach from prompt metadata
- **Multi-modal Routing** → Handles text, images, embeddings seamlessly

### Internal Dialogue Capability
- **Brain can talk to itself** using the same prompt routing infrastructure
- **Self-reflection mechanism** → Brain asks itself clarifying questions
- **Multi-perspective analysis** → "What would happen if I tried X vs Y?"
- **Decision validation** → "Does this make sense given what I know?"

## Key Concept

This is a **"Think First, Then Act"** architecture where:
- **Agent** = Intelligent prompt orchestrator + action executor (interface to reality)
- **Brain** = Pure thinking machine with prompt router + thought processors
- **Prompt Router** = The decision gateway that routes thoughts to appropriate processing engines
