# Sprint Plan: Intent Relationship Mapping PoC

**Sprint Goal**: Build proof-of-concept for intelligent intent relationship mapping using multi-stage LLM pipeline

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High - Foundation for advanced meta-reasoning capabilities  
**Status**: Planning Phase

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Create a sophisticated three-stage pipeline that takes user intent and generates a comprehensive relationship graph showing how intent connects to goals, constraints, resources, actions, and execution paths.

### **Why This Matters**
- **Foundation for AI Planning**: Intent relationship mapping is core to intelligent task decomposition
- **Proof of Architecture**: Validates multi-stage LLM approach for complex inference
- **Extensible Design**: Architecture scales to ownership, system, and process relationships later
- **Real Business Value**: Transforms vague user requests into actionable execution plans

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Three-Stage Pipeline**

```
User Intent → Stage 1: Intent Scoping → Stage 2: Analysis Planning → Stage 3: Relationship Execution → Intent Graph
```

**Stage 1: Intent Scoping** (Enhanced extract_prompt_scope)
- Try direct answer first for simple questions
- If complex: identify intent entities, categories, and information gaps
- Output: Direct answer OR analysis requirements

**Stage 2: Intent Analysis Planning** (New advanced scoping tool)
- Convert intent categories to specific relationship mapping tools
- Structure information gaps and human-in-the-loop questions
- Output: Detailed execution plan with tool specifications

**Stage 3: Intent Relationship Execution** (Lightweight focused inference)
- Execute series of focused LLM calls for specific relationship types
- Merge results into comprehensive intent relationship graph
- Output: Complete NetworkX-compatible intent graph
